- Most models can run on CPU, but performance will vary
- More cores and higher clock speeds improve performance
- Modern CPUs with AVX2/AVX512 provide better performance

### RAM

- Minimum: 8GB for small models (1-3B parameters)
- Recommended: 16GB+ for medium models (7-13B parameters)
- Large models (30B+): 32GB or more

### GPU

- NVIDIA GPUs: CUDA acceleration for most providers
- AMD GPUs: ROCm support in some providers
- Apple Silicon: Metal acceleration (especially with Exo)

### Disk Space

- Models typically require 2-10GB each
- Consider SSD storage for faster loading times

## Best Practices

### Model Selection

- **Start small**: Begin with smaller models (1-7B) and move up as needed
- **Specialized models**: Use code-specific models for programming tasks
- **Quantized models**: Lower precision models use less memory with minimal quality loss

### Performance Optimization

- **Adjust context size**: Smaller context windows use less memory
- **Batch requests**: When possible, batch multiple requests
- **GPU offloading**: Enable GPU acceleration when available
- **Close other applications**: Free up memory for model inference

### Provider Selection

Choose the provider that best matches your needs:

- **Ease of use**: Ollama and GPT4All are simplest to set up
- **Performance**: Llama.cpp and Exo offer highest performance
- **Customization**: LM Studio and Llama.cpp provide most options
- **Java integration**: JLama is ideal for Java developers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Model Loading Fails

- Check you have sufficient RAM
- Verify model files are not corrupted
- Try a smaller or more quantized model

#### Slow Response Times

- Lower the context window size
- Use a smaller or more quantized model
- Enable GPU acceleration if available
- Increase thread count (CPU inference)

#### Connection Errors

- Verify the provider service is running
- Check the endpoint URL in DevoxxGenie settings
- Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection
- Verify the correct port is configured

#### Out of Memory

- Close other memory-intensive applications
- Try a more heavily quantized model
- Reduce the context window size
- Use a smaller model

## Future Directions

Local LLM technology is rapidly evolving:

- **Smaller, more efficient models**: Better performance on consumer hardware
- **Improved quantization**: Higher quality with lower precision
- **Better GPU utilization**: More efficient acceleration
- **Specialized models**: Models optimized for specific tasks like coding
- **Fine-tuning tools**: Easier customization of models for specific domains
