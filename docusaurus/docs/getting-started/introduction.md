## What is DevoxxGenie?

DevoxxGenie is a fully Java-based LLM Code Assistant plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, designed to integrate with both local LLM providers and cloud-based LLM services.

With DevoxxGenie, developers can leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve code quality, solve problems faster, and learn new concepts, all within their familiar IDE environment.

## Key Features

DevoxxGenie provides a rich set of features to enhance your development workflow:

- **Multiple LLM Providers**: Connect to local LLMs like Ollama, LMStudio, and GPT4All, as well as cloud-based providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq, and more.
- **MCP Support**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for advanced agent-like capabilities, allowing the LLM to access external tools and services.
- **Git Diff/Merge**: Show Git Diff/Merge dialog to accept LLM suggestions.
- **Chat History**: Your chats are stored locally, allowing you to easily restore them in the future.
- **Project Scanner**: Add source code (full project or by package) to prompt context when using compatible LLM providers.
- **Token Cost Calculator**: Calculate the cost when using Cloud LLM providers.
- **Web Search**: Search the web for a given query using Google or Tavily.
- **Streaming responses**: See each token as it's received from the LLM in real-time.
- **DnD Images**: Drag and drop images with multimodal LLM support.
- **100% Java**: Built entirely in Java using the Langchain4J library.
