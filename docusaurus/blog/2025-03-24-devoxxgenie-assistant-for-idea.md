# DevoxxGenie: Your AI Assistant for IDEA

DevoxxGenie is a powerful AI-powered assistant for IntelliJ IDEA that helps developers be more productive by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike other code assistants, DevoxxGenie is built entirely in Java and offers unique flexibility by supporting both local and cloud-based LLM providers.

## A New Approach to AI Code Assistance

Most AI coding assistants lock you into a specific model or cloud provider. DevoxxGenie takes a different approach, giving you the freedom to choose how you want to use AI in your development workflow:

- Run models locally for privacy and offline use
- Connect to cloud providers for more powerful capabilities
- Switch between providers as needed without changing tools

## Key Features

DevoxxGenie offers a comprehensive set of features that integrate seamlessly with your development workflow:

### Multi-Provider LLM Support

Connect to a wide range of LLM providers:
- **Local Providers**: Ollama, LMStudio, GPT4All, Llama.cpp, and more
- **Cloud Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Mistral, Groq, Google (Gemini), and others

### Advanced Context Features

- **MCP Support**: Access external tools and services for enhanced capabilities
- **Project Scanner**: Add source code to prompt context for better responses
- **Chat Memory**: Maintain conversation context for more coherent assistance

### Developer-Focused Tools

- **Git Diff/Merge**: Review and accept AI-generated code changes with a Git diff interface
- **Web Search**: Augment LLM knowledge with web search results
- **Token Cost Calculator**: Manage API usage efficiently
- **MCP Support**: Model Context Protocol for extended capabilities

## Getting Started

Setting up DevoxxGenie is easy. Install the plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace, connect it to your preferred LLM provider, and start prompting. The plugin supports various workflows:

1. **Code Explanation**: Select code and ask for explanations
2. **Generation**: Request code generation for specific functionality
3. **Refactoring**: Get suggestions for code improvements
4. **Learning**: Ask questions about frameworks, libraries, or concepts

## Why DevoxxGenie?

1. **Built in Java**: Created by Java developers for the Java ecosystem
2. **Provider Flexibility**: Use any supported LLM provider
3. **Privacy Options**: Run models locally to keep your code private
4. **Deep Integration**: Works seamlessly with IntelliJ IDEA
5. **Open Source**: Community-driven development

## The Future of DevoxxGenie

The DevoxxGenie team is actively working on enhancing the plugin with new features:

- **Enhanced MCP Support**: More specialized tools for development tasks
- **Agentic AI**: More sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities
- **Enhanced MCP Support**: More specialized tools for development tasks
- **Improved Multimodal Support**: Better handling of visual elements
